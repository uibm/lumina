      <li><strong>Production-grade aesthetics</strong> - Professional typography and spacing</li>
      <li><strong>Lightning fast</strong> - Static generation means instant page loads</li>
      <li><strong>Complete customization</strong> - Change anything, anytime</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Built With</h2>
