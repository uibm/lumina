# TOON: A Token-Efficient Format for LLM Data Exchange

As AI becomes more accessible and context windows expand, the cost of LLM tokens remains a critical consideration. Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) addresses this by providing a compact, human-readable encoding of JSON data specifically optimized for large language models.

## The Problem with JSON Verbosity

Standard JSON is verbose and token-expensive. Consider this employee data:

```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "salary": 75000,
      "active": true
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob",
      "department": "Sales",
      "salary": 65000,
      "active": true
    }
  ]
}
```

While YAML reduces this somewhat, TOON achieves even greater compression:

```toon
employees[2]{id,name,department,salary,active}:
  1,Alice,Engineering,75000,true
  2,Bob,Sales,65000,true
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Tabular Arrays

TOON's sweet spot is uniform arrays of objects. Instead of repeating field names for every record, it declares them once in a header and streams values as CSV-style rows:

```toon
users[3]{id,name,role}:
  1,Alice,admin
  2,Bob,user
  3,Carol,moderator
```

### 2. Explicit Structure

The format provides guardrails that help LLMs understand and validate data:

- **Length declarations**: `[N]` tells the model exactly how many items to expect
- **Field headers**: `{field1,field2}` establishes the schema upfront
- **Indentation**: Nesting is visually clear without braces

### 3. LLM-Friendly Guardrails

These structural hints improve parsing reliability. Benchmarks show TOON achieves 74% accuracy versus JSON's 70% across four models, while using approximately 40% fewer tokens.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Token Efficiency

Measured using GPT-5's `o200k_base` tokenizer:

```
Time-series analytics (60 days):
  TOON:          9,120 tokens
  JSON:         22,250 tokens  (59.0% more)
  JSON compact: 14,216 tokens  (35.8% more)

GitHub repositories (100 repos):
  TOON:          8,744 tokens
  JSON:         15,144 tokens  (42.3% more)
  JSON compact: 11,454 tokens  (23.7% more)
```

### Accuracy Results

Testing across 209 data retrieval questions on 4 models:

```
Format          Accuracy    Tokens
TOON            73.9%       2,744
JSON compact    70.7%       3,081
YAML            69.0%       3,719
JSON            69.7%       4,545
```

TOON achieves higher accuracy with 39.6% fewer tokens than formatted JSON.

## When to Use TOON

TOON excels with:

- **Uniform arrays of objects** (100% tabular eligibility)
- **API responses** with consistent record structures
- **Analytics data** with time-series or metrics
- **Database exports** where schema is stable

Consider alternatives when:

- Data is deeply nested or non-uniform
- You need CSV's extreme compactness for flat tables
- Latency is more critical than token cost

## Implementation Example

Converting JSON to TOON using the TypeScript library:

```typescript
import { encode } from '@toon-format/toon'

const data = {
  metrics: [
    { date: "2025-01-01", views: 5715, clicks: 211 },
    { date: "2025-01-02", views: 7103, clicks: 393 }
  ]
}

console.log(encode(data))
```

Output:

```toon
metrics[2]{date,views,clicks}:
  2025-01-01,5715,211
  2025-01-02,7103,393
```

## Integration with LLMs

When using TOON with language models:

1. **Show the format** instead of describing it - models parse it naturally once they see the pattern
2. **Wrap in code blocks**: Use ` ```toon` for syntax highlighting
3. **Provide headers** when asking models to generate TOON output
4. **Use tab delimiters** for even better token efficiency

Example prompt structure:

````
Here's the data in TOON format:

```toon
products[3]{id,name,price,stock}:
  1,Widget,29.99,150
  2,Gadget,49.99,75
  3,Doohickey,19.99,200
```

Question: How many products have stock below 100?
````

## Language Support

TOON has implementations in multiple languages:

- **Official**: TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, .NET, Java, Dart
- **Community**: PHP, Ruby, Swift, Elixir, OCaml, Perl, C++, and more

## Tooling Ecosystem

- **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting, validation, conversion
- **Tree-sitter Grammar**: For Neovim, Helix, Emacs, Zed
- **Online Playgrounds**: Interactive token comparison tools
- **CLI Tool**: Quick JSON ↔ TOON conversions

## Real-World Use Cases

### API Data Transfer

When sending product catalogs to LLMs for analysis:

```toon
products[100]{id,name,category,price,rating,reviews}:
  1,Laptop Pro,Electronics,1299.99,4.5,2847
  2,Office Chair,Furniture,399.99,4.2,1523
  ...
```

### Analytics Dashboards

Time-series data for LLM-powered insights:

```toon
daily_metrics[30]{date,revenue,users,conversions}:
  2025-01-01,45231.50,1523,89
  2025-01-02,52847.25,1847,103
  ...
```

### Database Query Results

Exporting query results for LLM processing:

```toon
user_activity[500]{user_id,action,timestamp,duration_ms}:
  101,page_view,2025-01-28T10:15:30Z,2340
  102,purchase,2025-01-28T10:16:45Z,15670
  ...
```

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Advantages

- Significant token savings (30-60% vs JSON)
- Better LLM comprehension accuracy
- Self-documenting structure
- Lossless JSON round-trips
- Minimal syntax to learn

### Limitations

- Requires uniform data structures for maximum benefit
- Not ideal for deeply nested or irregular data
- Slightly larger than CSV for pure flat tables
- Smaller ecosystem than JSON (but growing)

## Future Developments

The TOON specification is stable but evolving based on community feedback. Active areas of development include:

- Enhanced streaming APIs for large datasets
- Additional language implementations
- Editor plugins for more platforms
- Integration with popular data tools

## Conclusion

TOON represents a thoughtful evolution in data formats for the LLM era. By combining YAML's readability with CSV's compactness and adding structural guardrails, it delivers measurable improvements in both token efficiency and model accuracy.

For applications where token costs matter and data has consistent structure, TOON offers a compelling alternative to JSON. As the ecosystem matures and more tools adopt it, TOON is positioned to become a standard format for LLM data exchange.
