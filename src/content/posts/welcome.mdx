# Welcome to Lumina

Lumina is a production-ready blogging platform built on modern web standards, giving you complete control over your content while maintaining exceptional reading experience and performance.

## What Makes Lumina Different

Unlike traditional blogging platforms, Lumina provides:

- **Complete Ownership** - Your content lives in Git, not in a proprietary database
- **Zero Platform Lock-in** - Pure markdown files you can migrate anywhere
- **Production-Grade Design** - Professional typography and spacing
- **Exceptional Performance** - Static generation means instant page loads
- **Full Customization** - Modify anything from colors to layouts
- **Developer-Friendly** - Built with Astro, MDX, and modern CSS

## Beautiful Typography

Lumina uses carefully calibrated typography to create an optimal reading experience:

- **Font Size**: 18-21px body text for comfortable reading across devices
- **Line Height**: 1.65 for optimal readability and reduced eye strain
- **Line Length**: Maximum 65-75 characters per line following typographic best practices
- **Proper Spacing**: Generous whitespace that enhances content hierarchy

## Code Highlighting

Lumina uses Shiki for syntax highlighting, providing editor-quality code display:

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  publishDate: Date;
  tags: string[];
  featured: boolean;
}

function calculateReadingTime(content: string): number {
  const wordsPerMinute = 265;
  const wordCount = content.split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);
}

export async function getPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
  const posts = await getCollection('posts');
  return sortPostsByDate(posts);
}
```

## Dark Mode Support

Toggle between light and dark themes using the button in the header. Your preference is automatically saved to localStorage for persistence across sessions.

The dark mode implementation uses:
- Dark gray backgrounds (#0a0a0a) instead of pure black to reduce eye strain
- Reduced text brightness (87% opacity) for comfortable reading
- Carefully balanced contrast ratios for accessibility

## Content Organization

Organize your posts with tags for easy navigation and discovery. Each tag automatically gets its own dedicated page showing all related content.

## Getting Started

Start writing your own posts by creating markdown or MDX files in `src/content/posts/`. Each post supports:

- Custom frontmatter metadata (title, description, publish date, tags)
- Featured post designation for homepage highlighting
- Author attribution
- Optional update dates
- Draft status for work-in-progress content

Example frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A compelling description"
publishDate: 2025-01-20
tags: ["tutorial", "web-development"]
featured: true
author: "Your Name"
draft: false
---
```
