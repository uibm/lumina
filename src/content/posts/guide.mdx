# Building the Perfect Blog

This guide walks you through the key decisions and features that make Lumina special.

## Design Philosophy

The goal was simple: create a blog that looks better than Medium, loads faster than Substack, and gives you more control than any platform.

### Typography First

Good typography is the foundation of any great reading experience. Lumina uses:

- Fluid typography that scales smoothly across devices
- Proper line length (65-75 characters) for optimal reading
- Generous line-height (1.65) that reduces eye strain
- Text wrapping that prevents awkward orphans

### Performance Matters

Static generation means pages load instantly. No JavaScript frameworks, no client-side rendering delays, just pure HTML and CSS.

## Key Features

### Markdown + MDX

Write in markdown for simplicity, use MDX components when you need interactivity. Best of both worlds.

### Dark Mode Done Right

Most dark modes fail because they just invert colors. Lumina uses:

- Dark gray backgrounds (#0a0a0a) instead of pure black
- Reduced brightness text (87% opacity) to prevent eye strain
- Desaturated accent colors for better contrast

### Tag System

Organize your content with tags. Each tag gets its own page showing all related posts.

### Featured Posts

Highlight your best work by marking posts as featured. They'll appear in a special section on the homepage.

## Customization

Everything is customizable:

```css
:root {
  --color-accent: #3b82f6; /* Change this to customize your theme */
  --font-size-body: clamp(1rem, 0.95rem + 0.25vw, 1.125rem);
  --content-width: min(65ch, calc(100% - 3rem));
}
```

Change colors, fonts, spacing, layouts - it's all CSS custom properties.

## Deployment

Push to GitHub, and GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys your site. Zero configuration needed.

## Conclusion

Building your own blog platform gives you complete freedom. No algorithms, no paywalls, no platform politics. Just you and your content.
